If you've ever played "Heads Up!" before, you know how fun and addicting it can be! It often provides a great deal of boisterous chaos and belly laughs with family and friends. Therefore, lots of Disney-goers have recognized that it can be a great way to pass the time while waiting in long lines at Disney! 

However, the game has it's downsides.

Although, it allows you to download the "Disney Parks" deck for free when at Walt Disney World, the selection can feel thin, and the cards often repeat, making a less-than-ideal experience. Fortunately, players can jump to a small selection of free decks, but it doesn't quite keep the Disney magic alive when the decks aren't Disney themed.

Additionally, while playing the game, the battery life of your phone can take a huge hit. This is mostly due to the fact that you have to rely on an internet connection in order to play at all times! Not everyone has a data plan suited for this.

The game isn't free either. It provides some free decks, but any deck worth their salt will cost at least $1 each. Everyone knows how expensive Disney is, so spending more money on apps is the last thing a Disney-goer wants!

If you're playing with younger kids, which is often the case on a Disney trip, some younger children under the age of 6 or so can struggle to sound out the words, and often feel left out. Several reviews on the app store have called for displaying pictures of the clues instead of words, but the game has yet to add this functionality.

There must be a similar game that provides free Disney-theme decks that doesn't drain the battery, require internet connection to play, and can provide fun for the entire family...

Introducing ["Wait Up!"](https://waitupgame.com)

"Wait Up!" is a brilliant alternative to "Heads Up!" and is geared towards Disney-goers since the decks are 100% Disney-themed. Some of the titles of the decks include: "Disney Movies," "Disney Characters," "Pixar," and "Ladies of Disney." A couple of the decks are tagged with a "Kids" ribbon, indicating that the cards will show images instead of text, which is great for the younger ones!

"Wait Up!" is a community driven game and even [includes decks and updates that were inspired by other Disney-goers!](https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/cfz3vy/i_made_a_disney_themed_version_of_the_mobile_game/)

The biggest difference with this game is that it's actually a *web app* as opposed to a native app. What this means is that you actually don't download it from the app store, but instead you go to https://waitupgame.com on your mobile or tablet device and then add the game to your homescreen. This enables players to launch the game from the homescreen, like any other app, and enables them to play without internet connection!

Another difference is that the game doesn't use the camera while you're playing, which is another downside to "Heads Up!" since recording your play isn't optional. This most likely contributes to the battery drainage issue, as well. 

A big pro to this game is that the game clock is adjustable. While "Heads Up!" locks the game clock at 60 seconds, "Wait Up!" allows you to adjust it from 60, 90, and 120 seconds. Again, making it better for kids who can take longer to articulate the clues to others. Included in the same settings menu is an option to enable or disabled sound effects. That way you can receive calls and texts without putting your phone on silent.

Overall, we see "Wait Up!" as a scrappy, but ultimately, a better alternative to "Heads Up!" for Disney families. The extensive amount of Disney decks can keep a Disney family busy for their entire trip, whether they're waiting in line at Space Mountain, or getting in the mood for an upcoming trip. 

As a life-long Disney-goer, "Wait Up!" is exactly what we needed.
